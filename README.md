# Detect-Track-and-count-objects-in-live-videos-using-YOLOv8-ByteTrack
This project includes two COLAB notebooks (Train and Test) for detecting, tracking and counting falling bolts and nuts in live videos. We use YOLOv8 which is most updated and powerful version of YOLO model. It is super fast and accurate and tehrfore its best choice for our project.

The tracking process is done using ByteTrack method. The dataset is consists of three subsets (train - test - valid).


the train dataset is 4 min long while test and valid videos are 1 min long for each. The annotations related to each dataset is provided in JSON format.

All Colab notebooks and datasets are provided in this repository.
